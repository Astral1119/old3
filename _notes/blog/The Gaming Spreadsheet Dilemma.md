### Introduction

Perhaps you've been playing your video game for a month, a year, a decade. Eventually, you decide that there must be a better way of farming a resource or calculating damage or storing crafting recipes or documenting every collectable or whatever else and so you turn to spreadsheets. Wonderful.

But, you don't know where to start. So you scour the internet for help and somehow have ended up here, probably due to someone very smart on a help forum telling you that what you're attempting isn't feasible and here's a list of reasons why.

Within Google Sheets forums, not all spreadsheets are created equally. Spreadsheets made for video games tend to fall to the bottom of the hierarchy. In order to understand why volunteers don't like working on video game sheets, I've compiled a list.

### Gamers Don't Spreadsheet

Gamers are generally not familiar with what 'best practice' constitutes or how to use proper data structures. Likewise, gamers don't know how the conventions of asking questions in a help forum or how to navigate channels of communication. This makes for an altogether difficult experience for any volunteer who deigns to assist.

Frequently, gamers will ask for features that can't be achieved in spreadsheets. They don't know its limitations, and frankly there *is* a point where spreadsheets are the wrong tool of choice. As my good friend [tomf](https://www.reddit.com/user/6745408/) remarks, "it all boils down to 'sheets isn't a website.'" Not knowing the limits of spreadsheets is problematic when asking for help, and understandably many volunteers don't appreciate being asked the impossible.

### Games are Big Projects

As a general rule, spreadsheets based on video games are large in scope and scale. Often, when you ask for help with your damage calculator, you're asking a stranger to invest a significant amount of their time in your project to learn the game mechanics, develop a solution, and implement it within an already flawed framework.

Furthermore, large sheets come with their own problems. As scale increases, the importance a proper foundation and good practice—both of which tend to be crucially lacking in game sheets—skyrockets. When images and imported data become involved, as often happens with this kind of spreadsheet, the complexity puts off most.

### Results Over Learning

I get it. You started figuring out spreadsheets in order to enhance your gameplay or give your community another resource. Developing an end product takes priority over knowing how it works. However, this mindset is really difficult for forum helpers to work with.

If you've already been helped, you're probably not interested in how a given formula works, or if you are, not to the extent that you'd set aside time to fully dissect it. It should be pretty obvious why this is problematic. You can't debug, or make modifications, or update it, or really do anything except point at it and say that "it's not working." Ultimately if it ever does break down, either you won't even notice because you don't know how it works or you will notice and have to return back to ask for even more help.

### Reticent to Change

So you've just started to figure out this whole spreadsheet thing, and you've started to really build up your sheet. But for some reason, this person on the internet is telling you that your structure is awful and complaining about working with it and won't stop pleading for you to change it. But you've already poured hours of work into setting it up like this and you're pretty sure working around it would be easier.

This issue is pretty common, especially if your project is already operating. However, if you're going to rack up tech debt, offloading it onto someone on a help forum is considered a faux pas. You're giving a problem to someone which they might ordinarily entertain, but then adding on a number of restrictions that they would have to work around. If you're not using a standard table, for instance, they might have to familiarize themselves with your current paradigm when they ordinarily wouldn't have to. Understanding all of the idiosyncrasies of your current setup for free is pretty unreasonable.

### Bad Examples, Bad Advice

Maybe you're out there being proactive, looking at spreadsheets people have made for other video games. Maybe you're looking at tutorials and piecing stuff together. That's great. It's a shame that so much of the material isn't applicable.

Existing video game spreadsheets are often problematic for the very reasons listed in this post, so it should come as no surprise that relying on other video game spreadsheets as references can be ultimately detrimental.

The thing about spreadsheet tutorials is that they are very often designed for financial and professional use. When it comes to interpreting game mechanics or developing complex formulae, they have little to offer—because that's not the target demographic. Despite this, people very often try to MacGyver an ad hoc solution that is nigh-opaque to anyone else. This idea plays back into how [[The Gaming Spreadsheet Dilemma#Gamers Don't Spreadsheet|gamers don't spreadsheet]]. This is not to say that tutorials are not useful in a general sense—just that relying entirely on them is ultimately problematic.

### So, What Should I Do?

It's easy to say, "just learn how to use spreadsheets," but obviously that's not particularly useful. Learning how to use spreadsheets at a high level is difficult and time-consuming. While it is ultimately up to you if you feel that it is worthwhile, understand that the alternative is offloading the work onto others.If those others are paid via Upwork or Fiverr, then there's no issue—but if you are relying on forums, then you should understand that you are effectively asking people to do work for you for free with no expectation of ever learning how.

However, if you do want to learn spreadsheets, I encourage you to engage with the spreadsheet help communities with the intent to develop your skills. The road to proper spreadsheet usage is surprisingly short, and if you wish to travel it I have no doubt you will be able to learn.

Good luck with the project. Signing off,
